To celebrate nearly 40 years of the Ferrari F40, the prancing horse organized a tour that took almost 40 F40 supercar owners through the Italian countryside.

##  Pop-Up Headlight Cars May Never See Production Again, But These Classics Are Here to Stay 
Pop-up headlights, also referred to as flip-up headlights or hidden headlamps, were prominent features on sports cars from the ’80s and ‘90s. The pop-up headlight feature gave cars more character, making them take on a cartoony human-like appearance when opened and providing a more streamlined look when down and not in use. Pop-up headlights made…

**1****History**
An anniversary in... supercar style
As part of the Ferrari 40th anniversary celebrations, the F40 was presented to the press on 21 July, its name with a new-style acronym acting as a reminder of the anniversary. 
It was an exceptional car, capable of extreme performance thanks to its twin-turbo engine packing almost 160 bhp/l of specific power, and with a captivating appearance, with its large wraparound rear wing. It was a race car for road use.
![Ferrari F40](https://cdn.ferrari.com/cms/network/media/img/resize/66d70775d6a2ea0010d50987-1987_f40_cassetto-archivio_01)
The F40 was an evolution of Ferrari's extreme car philosophy initiated with the GTO, taking it to even higher levels. The car left everyone breathless from its first appearance: a muscular supercar with extreme performance, it seemed born for competition.
The F40 name derived from “F” for Ferrari and the number 40, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first Ferrari approved for road use. It was also the last car unveiled to the public in the ubiquitous presence of Enzo Ferrari, who died in August 1988.

Maybe it’s because of its lines, charm, or supercar performance, but the F40 was loved from the outset by Ferrari enthusiasts. Even before it went into production and without knowing the actual number of units produced, customers queued up cheque book in hand. It was just so innovative and so covetable that people wanted it, and they wanted it now! And so, its success didn’t stop even once production ended in 1992, and after 1311 cars left the Maranello factory: They changed hands on the second-hand market at around one million euros.

###  Top-levelperformance
The F40’s performance was that of a true supercar: its claimed top speed was 324 km/h. It accelerated from 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.1 seconds, covered 0 to 400 m in 11.9 seconds, and reached 0 to 1000 m in 20.9 seconds.
**3****Design**

Newstyle
While the cabin profile and satin black painted side indent line bore a distant resemblance to the 308, the radical body styling was all new, as were its construction materials.
**4****Technology**

###  Thedifferenceisinthematerials
The F40 was the first Ferrari production car to use mainly composite materials for its body panels, which totalled only eleven pieces due to the large single unit front and rear sections.
