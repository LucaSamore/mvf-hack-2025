    "comment": "yeah the prototype... http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2007/05/03/days-of-ferrari-day-xvi/ 74049&#8217;s true singularity lies in its powerplant. The standard F40 engine is a Tipo F120A, while the higher output F40 LM used a Tipo F120B. Interestingly, the engine plate on 74049 states that it has a Tipo F120AB, which may be a cross between the two. Although most major components are the same as a standard F40, 74049 is believed to produce about 100hp more than the 478hp that a European model F40 produced (tested at 7,500 rpm without air passing through the intercoolers). This makes it only about 160 horsepower shy of an LM. The IHI turbos are different from stock, but not the same as the ones on an LM. The ECU is an enhanced one-off unit. Intercoolers are standard, but do not wear the BEHR lettering of the street units. As with European models, there is no catalytic converter and many of the brackets for the exhaust system are hand-fabricated. The air cleaners are also subtly different for no apparent reason. The fuel cell housing is made from carbon fiber. BTW factory experience cars were a various type of experimental cars, but there are some stock cars with in the experience cars."

    "comment": "Here we go again. Do a search and you will see the firestorm of this topic. You are asking two different questions: 1) are there differences and 2) are they priced differently. I'll start with this. From personal experience of what I have seen, build quality differs a lot from car to car. I have seen '90s and '91s that are way better than a lot of '92s. I have also seen some stellar '92s. Many people seem to think that the cars were just built better and better as time went on but I have seen two '92s where it looked like they just phoned it in. The panels were way off, the glue was weird, the welds were even worse than usual. You will find guys who will say the complete opposite. What this means is that you have to look at each car individually and go by each car's pluses and minuses. As far as differences, there were three different types of carbon kevlar weave made through out the run (at least on US cars) that I have seen. None of these are better than the others, just different. Beyond that, later cars have mechanical updates like a better placed clutch bleeder and some other stuff (compare differences in the oil caps, for instance). As far as value, people sometimes do ask more for '92s because it's a '92 but the actual price  an educated buyer pays is based on the condition of the car. F40 quality can vary so wildly and so many have serious deferred maintenance issues that you need to buy the best car you can, regardless of year or mileage. Low miles isn't always better with these. Hope that helps."

Whenever I buy a diecast model car (or before I buy one) I search over the internet to gather informations about the 1:1 car. Anyway, it hasn't been a problem until now. I've recently bought F40 Lightweight version with black OZ magnesium rims. Very, very nice car. The trouble is that I can't find any info on the 1:1 car. I know that there are a couple of versions of F40 : \"regular\", GTE, LM,...but no Lightweight in the official classification. I've tried to google about it but with no luck. The only one I've found was the red one on Duch plates (Netherlands). That car is the same as my diecast car, but there are only pics of it and no text. As I can see from the pictures, the main difference between stock F40 and LW version, besides rims, are the exhaust pipes. From the LW name I can only conclude that it is lighter than stock F40, or maybe I'm wrong? Does anyone know anything about the story of F40 LW (not LM)? Thanx."

It also seems to me F40 and F50 cannot co-exist because the two camps have a very different idea of what a good race car should be. I am totally neutral in this matter although I do prefer the F50 a bit more than the F40, for not having to work so hard to get the performance out (based on the opinion expressed here). IMO, I think the two cars represent two different times in car design that both have their merits and faults and that is why I love to own both to experience the differences. Having said that, I am relatively new to this hobby than many of your here and I am so used to the ease of driving in modern cars (993TT, 996TT, M3, 355, 550, 360, CS, Diablo) that honestly I am a little hesitant about getting a F40, after reading all your comments. I guess I might need to either borrow or rent a F40 for a week to experience it before I can make my decision (which is to swap my CS for a F40). Will keep you posted about the progress."

    "comment": "The other wing on my car was one of the first Tubi wings. They are no longer available. That wing was clear coated for show. The consistency of the wing profile was pretty bad. This wing is a lot stronger and the quality is much better. Without a rear wing, my car is able to spin the rear tires at 100 mph on the freeway. With this wing it will not spin them at 70mph. I don't have lap times to compare, but the rear of the car does stick much better in the corners. This wing was on Amirs F40 when he set the record at the Virginia City Hill climb. So I know it works. Actually, I never said it was a \"Copy\". I said it has the same wing shapes. As I stated above, the Tubi wing we had as a sample was really pretty bad. This first wing did not have the end plates drilled for adjustment. A new set  that is adjustable is now fitted. There is also a Gurney flap available for maximum down force."

How does it hold the large stress created by engine torque and aerodynamic down force? It's seems like the F40 chassis is like two bicycle frames welded together side by side. It's probably so strong because the philosophy behind the chassis comes from bicycle, bike frame engineering. That's big step forward. I will speak with local bike folks and try to get more info about science stuff."

A total weight of 960 kg. Specially made on order of Mr Blaton by an Italian-Swiss team, under supervision of Argentinian Mario Navarete and former technicians from the Coloni F1 team. Using a Hewland 5 speed box and a V8 biturbo engine relates it to a F 40. The engine is attached to the cage for overall stiffness. Suspension uses F1 technology."

He also drove the 330P4 in 1967 to 3rd row with Mairesse. I think we must open a thread to this special person, as i see many of you don't know him. He also owned the very first F50 delivered #103097, especially deliverd by the factory with yellow and black stripe, being the Belgian Flag. I met him several times, and visited his private museum, un 'grand' Monsieur. He also let made the 348 'ecurie Francorchamps' for him. He owned an Ferrari F1 of Berger, a 308 Competizione, a 288 GTO, F40 LM, and several other F1 cars and Ferrari cars. His daughter was also married with Jacky Ickx....."

It looks like it wouldn't be very strong when you look at just the steel frame, and you're right it's not, you have to have the shear panels for the strength.  It's very strong and light when done correctly but not easy to make a car the magnitude of an F40 as your first project working with composites.  Luckily, composite manufacturing has come a really long way since the F40 was actually made so IMO it would be doable but lots of work and not inexpensive."

Try to find a IHI turbo dealer and check some of the turboed import forums (supra, rx-7, etc) as they use IHIs on some of the aftermarket kits......APEXi is one of the manufacturers that uses them. They actually have a ball bearing abraidable seal IHI. very very fast spool. *EDIT* D'oh, a little too late of a reply and seems that someone says that IHIs arent rebuildable. oh well."

The power curve feels much different, I've got the wastegate set very conservatively as I wanted to put on a few hundered miles before really dialing them in.  They seem less binary then the earlier models, the boost builts more evenly across the power range.  Prior the Turbos would come on and the acceleration was scarey, now its less violent.  I'm hoping this is all wastegate tuning as I loved getting pasted to the drivers seat.... Again I'm not sure if this is the turbos or the gate but I'll let you know when I start playing with the wastegate.  I'm thinking about doing the chip change as well, but I want to make incremental changes to see each components effects on the cars behavior. The thing thats upsetting me is the reduction of the turbo swoosh - or as my wife calls it the dentist chair in the rear.  Its definitely not as pronounced a sound - oh well small price to pay. One thing I wanted to tell you is that when the shop put everything back they put the cat's back in with my LM exhaust (normally I run test pipes) I was shocked when it sounded just a bit louder then my street tubi exhaust.  I left the cat's in for the break in period (I'm sure the guy next door paid the shop)....Its strange I don't think I'll ever go back to my street Tubi after hearing the difference. Jon"

I think the Cats and LM's have a throatier sound to them over the test pipes and Tubi's. Or Hell, maybe test pipes and LM pipes to wake up the 'hood The new turbos do seem to kick in sooner for me also. My car can spin the rear tires with a part throttle squeeze at 100 mph. Anyone got a source for a rear wing??? I REALLY need one. I think you should try a set of chips. Rod has them 949 631-6373. Enjoy, Rick"

    "comment": "The best race car on the track is the one that is easy to drive and completely predictable.  That being said the differance between the 40 and the 50 simply shows the evolution of the marque.  We all get a thrill from the raw, unpredictable power the 40 gives, but the 50 gives near the same power in a controled package.  Tubi headers, test pipes and muffler and advanced cam timing make the sound and the feel of a 50 an unbelieveable thrill.  Every single sound the drive train gives off is experianced due to the engine / trans / rear suspension being hard bolted to the carbon tub.  Raw parts of the 50 are the heat that comes into the cockpit via the top exiting radiator air duct, and the noise (a beautiful sound it is).  Those that have watched the in car footage of the Calloway Vette at say Daytona can get a close idea of the drive train sounds, add to that the scream of the 12 cylinder engine and you have magic.  The first thing that a passanger hears is the raising of the suspension to exit the parking lot, which sounds exactly like a commercial jetliner lowering the flaps on the tarmac.  This sound usually makes the hair on the back of the passangers neck stand on end and visualize this thing getting ready for take off!  Throttling it up through a couple of gears pushes you back in the seat much harder than any commercial jet could hope to do and the sound with the Tubi is very close to F1ish. The F50 engine is a beautiful design using only 1 gasket in the entire engine (stressed member, so gaskets would allow a flex point). Everything is oringed or Cooper ringed.  It was a F1 design, which means a sprint engine, not a long life engine.  Higher mileage will show some weak points.  Cams gear wear from the Morse type chain was the most noteable wear point I have found in these engines.  Another problem point is the intake track sealing.  There is much unfiltered air going in those engines when left in stock form, although it is fairly easily modified to correct these problems. Speed, power and completely controlable, all used in the same sentence while talking about a single model is a very high compliment to any designer!  I for one would never speak of the F50 as a second place car, I see it as every bit an equal to the 40. Dave"

I bought a burned out car from Japan about 4 years ago which had had the chassis number cut out from the frame as I think it should have been crushed after the insurance pay out, but someone had saved it. I mention this because at the same time we had a burned out 308 GTB chassis in the workshop. As soon as we had the F40 stripped down it was immediately obvious that the chassis were very very similar and clearly there wasn't much evolution from 308 to 288 to F40. I mention this because I think you could upgrade a 308 chassis quite easily. Work from how the F40 is done and get a decent race car chassis builder to advise you. I dont want to make you sick but I paid about £12k for the car which included a decent gearbox and rebuildable engine (though the heads needed replacing - Lancia LC30 heads are still available). I also got a brand new F40 engine for about £30k via Sheehan, and a stack of F40 LM parts, Enkei wheels, LM intercoolers, inlet trunking, LM turbos etc etc for about £12k in Switzerland about 3 years ago. Marcel Massini found the original chassis number from the engine and gearbox numbers on the burnt car. You can contact Simpson Motorsport UK who can supply almost everything to build an F40 at reasonable prices, including all the bodywork. Good luck!"

    "comment": "Your engine should be well broken in by this point. All of the engines spent a good deal of time on the dyno at the factory and saw red line numerous times durning those runs. I did a great deal of research on the build process, as the manual has many mistakes that had to be \"thought through\".  I was quite fortunate as John Amette was still with Ferrari at the time. He apprenticed with the Cooper race team while still living in England, and my race car back ground started in the 70's.  At the time of the rebuild, no one at the factory was there durning the F50 build ups, but there were engnrs that John and I could bounce questions back and forth with. This was a truely wonderful learning experiance as I had never had any experiance with a stressed member, gasketless engine before.  By nature of its design it is an extreemly stable package and doesnt suffer from many of the problems that a normal designed engine does.  This makes the break in period far quicker, as the expansion and twisting forces are at an absolute minumim. The standard Ferrari engine, with its many aluminum castings has a very unique (and measurable) growth process as they warm up. Understanding all of these variables that the engine encounters durning its many phases of warm up, obviously fascinated me and I spent months researching and learning all I could on this, and bouncing these ideas off of John. The F50 block being cast iron, then hard bolting the many aluminum castings to it, at opposing angles, keeps all in line from cold to hot thus the limited amount of break in for the rotating parts. Ring break in with the Nikosil plated liners is fairly quick as well and has happened well before the mileage of your engine. In your position, I would change the oil fairly quickly (after a thousand miles or so), cut the oil filter and inspect the filter media for any particles. If all looks well here, let her rip!  The red line, in both John's and my opnion, is set quite conservatively, and life in an F50 just begins at 6000 RPM.  At this point I must publically thank John Amette for his tolerance and time with all of my questions in this area. The knowledge that can be gained with support like his is incredible. He is terribly missed in the Ferrari circles and is a huge gain to the Lamborghini camp. We all have strange fascinations in one way or another. You happened to hit on one of mine.  Understanding the design of these engines is key to coaxing every ounce of performance out of them without turning them into a gernade. The IMSA 348 engine I just finished is a prime example of this.  The credit goes to someone else, as I simply made small changes to a well designed build up that gave well upwards of 500 HP with stock block and heads. Bolt on a slide valve manifold and add gobs more to the HP figure, according to the original builder! Change the oil, inspect the filter, strap in tight, warm up the tires and the engine until you see good oil temp, and let it rip. Waiting to hear your reaction..... Dave"

However it's not like that.  There are plenty cheap so called F40 replicas. F40 was technological innovation of late 80' and still is the symbol of super car. Why not use this unique design and  transform in to something even better. So, if the F40 is created as new it should represent today's modern technologies. From such point of view new car shouldn't be cheaper than 500K eur, and this is how it must be. Unfortunately I found just couple of F40 shaped projects with proper budget, attitude, and touch of 21th century."

The engine I finished is reported to have started life in the Spice IMSA car.  I have yet to put it on the dyno, but it has an incredible sound.  All internal were replaced, but it still runs a stock (modified) crank."

    "comment": "Ive heard there are F50's around that are closer to 600 HP with mods, can that be right? maybe with new ECU mapping, higher redline, and new cams etc? I can very easily believe the 600 hp claim, but have no experiance with it.  Consider the claimed hp figure for the stock 50, and then look at the fact that this has incredible low end torque for stop and go driving and meets federal emissions.  Take the plug out of the exhaust, eliminate the flat torque curve and shoot for top end HP with larger cams and valves....  I do not know what went into the building of the F50 GT car but I spent some time looking it over on a trip to Mill Valley Ferrari when we were getting schooled on the 456M.  Incredible car, but remember that was built as an enduro car.  Eliminate the need for it to last days on the track, build a sprint engine, and you can add a substancial amount to the HP figure that is claimed for that car as well.  Way over 600 I would believe, but praticle and streetable, no way!  Durning the 50 build I was doing, one of the engnrs at Ferrari said they tested the engine at well over the stock red line. As with many of the Ferrari's, they are still able to flow enough air to keep making more power above the red line, but to what end?  Life span decreases exponentially after a certain rpm."

    "comment": "LHD cars (at least where I live in Victoria and there are different rules for different sates in Aus.), have to be 25 years old to be allowed \"CLUB PLATE\" rego. And for full rego (with a lot more rules and regulations), the LHD car has to be 30 years old. Normal \"brand new\" RHD cars can be registered with the normal rules and regulations just as a 50 year old normal RHD car can be registered as well.  But once you get into LHD cars, you're stuck with the 25 year old problem. In other words you couldn't bring in an ENZO and register it unless it is 25 yeas old. I'm gong to try to rgister my F40 next Jan 2012, because the first F40 were built in 1987 and 1987 - 2012  is 25 years. Club plates have some really amazing advantages, for example normal rego is around $650 (if you live in the city) $540 if you live 20 miles out of the city (approx). Club rego is around $70 or something like that.  We have another, lets call it a tax, which we call \"transfer of registration fee, which is 8% of the price of the car.  e.g if you were to buy my F40 for say $700k and register it normally it would costs you 8% of $700k to have it transfered into your name.  With \"club Plate rego\", there is NO transfer of rego fee. Big saving right there. I have noticed recently since the new CLUB PLate rego rules came in which was the Jan-Feb this year, a lot of Ferrari guys are putting their cars on club plates. regards....."

The car wouldn't be able to comply to the engineering rules without a lot of modifications, like ride height, extrusion bars in the doors etc. etc. I'm registering mine on CLUB PLATES next January which allows me to drive it 90 days of the year, anywhere I want (will have a log book though......that's no big deal as far as I'm concerned) and be perfectly legal."

Can I just get a cat 'bypass pipe' , store the cats elesewhere, and be good to go?? Questions:   Will it be ridiculously lleaving the current Tubi set-up intact, but circumventing the cats? IS this a viable set-up?  or... Do I have to take a different approach? Second I am looking at the chip from www.tap1.com which comes with new valves for the turbos to increase boost pressures.   $595.  Anybody know anything about it?   It's in the FCA monthly...claims max 565hp with the setup.   Seems cheap! Thanks to all for your help! Carlo"

This is a subjective opinion and I'm one who likes to hear the car a bit.  The turbos do muffle the exhaust note somewhat also.  If it were me I'd remove the cats and put them in storage for the future.  I'm sure some more experienced F-40 people will speak up....."

I have been using it for years in 288+F40 with no outgassing of the mag which is what causes 95% of the hydraulic problems in those.

    "comment": "Its the water in the fluid that causes the problem glycol or not.  The outgassing is hydrogen gas that is produced by the corrosion reaction between the bellhousing and the steel fittings that are screwed into it.  That bellhousing will corrode  and you cannot stop it ,only slow it down.  I am on my original bellhousing  and I have changed to stainless steel fittings which are less electrochemically active.  Silicone brake fluid does not absorb water and the new fluid is much better than it used to be.  What AP fluid are you refering to?  Most magnesium castings from the era were pretty porous and ceramic sealing the hydraulic conduit is not a bad idea.  A sleeve would even be better.  Being compatible with magnesium only means that it is PH adjusted to prevent corrosion on magnesium.  Once the fluid is  wet it  will still cause a problem."

I only found out about it because I wrote an article about brake fluid a number of years ago and discovered it doing research. Been using it ever since. F40 uses seperate reserviors so you can use 2 different fluids but 288 does not. I abhor the idea of silicon fluid in a brake system so this is a good choice."

    "comment": "Silicone brake fluid is the only fluid that wont mix with water or absorb water.   It also has a neutral PH.  Its come a long way since the 70 when everyone in the SCCA used it because of its elevated boiling point.  Problem was that its compressible at high temperatures and used to give the feeling of a spongy pedal.  Better than no pedal.  Some have reported seal compatibility issues but that was a seal material problem.  Fact is that every brake system in the military from tanks to aircraft uses the stuff and it lasts forever and it completely noncorrosive.   All the motorcycle manufacturers use it as well.  Its come a long way since GE made it.  Repairing the clutch release bearing on an F40 is a big job.  Problem for us is that the factory does not retroactively fix issues.  I do have spare bellhousings but thats just so i dont have to refinish them!  In the clutch it really no issue.  What do you feel is the downside?"

Brakes are OK once you get used to them, and so is the shifter and the steering. It's noticeably faster than the GT3 RS in a straight line. In the curves, the RS is easier to drive faster because there is less body flex for better road feel and the steering, brakes and acceleration are instant with no waiting. But unless you're on a track, the F40 will stay with the RS OK. One big difference - the RS brakes will make your eyes pop out. You're not going to get that with the F40. Other than that, the RS (and CS) feel pretty much as raw as the F40 since there's not much electronics saving your butt in those cars. The sounds the F40 makes coming in and out of boost are pretty entertaining. I think that's one of the things I enjoy most about the F40. It's amazing how much the sound of a car adds to the driving pleasure, at least for me."

I guess he runs down the hill all the time to see the cars go by when he hears them coming. He almost had a heart attack that an F40 and RS actually stopped in front of his house! That never happened before! That's why his older brother joined him this time. We talked for a bit and gave them a good show when we left. Too bad I didn't think to offer them a ride.

I remember not too long ago as a 16 year youth seeing an F40 in person for the first time, hearing the rush of turbos. In pictures the F40 looks fantastic but in person its just much more jaw dropping. I asked the owner what he thought of the car and this was his reply \"Its a fantastic car every man should one\" There many be faster Ferrari's but few have the drama of an F40.

I am not especially surprised by this because it takes many years of hard work & dedication to build a comprehensive register, cars are constantly being bought & sold, so an effective register requires constant updating. Checking quickly, there is one F40 register online right now with a few cars (11 of them!), perhaps there are others.

It is a \"simple\" record, enrollment date, enrollment, complete vin, combination ... I can have some extra information on some of them. I leave it said in case someone is interested in this information and wants to exchange information ... I was surprised to see an F40 with a US VIN register in Spain."

This looks like a nice car to buy if you want to drive it rather than just add to a collection, but maybe not the best from a future values / investment point of view? I understand that the other car that is for sale that was also at Michelloto (for a full restoration after fire): http://www.pistonheads.com/sales/287244.htm has similar (but less extensive) upgrades, but that the original wheels, seats etc are still with the car. Any views on how these two cars compare?  I'm looking for something a bit more original/unique than a bog standard car, but if a modified car is less desirable to others in the market, perhaps I should be buying a standard car and then changing the wheels, exhaust etc. myself and keeping the old parts? Any advice welcome."

Ferrari used a variety of different weaves depending on the part and I think I might just have to track one down in the flesh to get an exact match.  I've also noticed quite a different variety in the way the engine bay was finished.  Some cars seem to have everything painted matte black while others have a mix of exposed composite and matte black pieces.  Interesting. There are a lot of great shots there for reference, definitely an epic thread worth viewing."

You can burn up the clutch pretty fast if the the system is leaking.  Nobody ever changes the clutch fluid and the reservoir is vented to atmosphere.  Griling makes a bellows that fits in the cap to stop this.  All of the f40's and 288's eventually need new bellhousings.  I switched to silicone fluid to avoid this.  I know it makes bad brake fluid but it works great in the clutch.  Stops the corrosion problem pretty quickly.  Look in your clutch reservoir to see if there is magnesium mud in it.

Mine has the quiet Tubi, I just wanted to know about loudness, and negative implications (if any) of deleting the cats in this config. Thanks again for your help."

I figure that any of the older cars are like an RRSP....except we can drive them!   If they are likely to appreciate ...it makes sense to speculate.  So I explained to my wife that \"it's just like borrowing for an RRSP'. That's my story and I am sticking to it. Ciao"

A set of local Pirelli's turned up, and a local astute Ferrari tyre specialist picked up that they were old stock, and the rubber was already going hard. I suggest you watch out for that. In the end, I bought a set of  17 inch Dunlop SP8000 from Tyre Rack in USA, since this was the only brand I could find at the time. They turned out to be quite good for street use. Recently I have bought 18 inch track tyres from Tyre Rack also, and both times their price was very competitive, and customer service was very good, delivery taking about 7 days."

There's nothing wrong with copyrighting your images - it doesn't matter if they are images that you took yourself, or if they're images that you purchased; if the images belong to you, then it's completely within your right to copyright those images. These days, too many people steal images from one place and then post them in another. Some people will go so far as to Photoshop someone else's copyright or watermark. Even though he said he intended no disrespect, texasmr2's attitude is clearly indicative of trying to start a fight - and on a topic about which he obviously knows little or even nothing: If you really don't care, why did you spend the time to quote Christian and reply to his posts? If you really didn't care, you wouldn't have replied at all. What's your issue here? Are you trying to bait Christian into some kind of an argument? No more clout in the subscribed sections, so you're venturing out here to cause trouble? Why is his copyright not justified? He paid for the images, he owns that property , why shouldn't he put measures in place to keep people from taking that for which he paid good money? Do you have an alarm on your house or your car? Do you hide your ATM pin from others? Why? What's the difference between you protecting your stuff and Christian protecting his stuff?"

I recommend getting a friend who has experience installing these types of chips, because they can be a little tricky sometimes. Radio Shack makes an IC installer that really works well. The Carobu chips are designed to be used with the LM turbos only, which if you haven't already done it is the best upgrade you can do for your F40. I believe I'm averaging around 19lbs of boost. But that's not solely determined by the chip. You can modify the wastegate spring tension to adjust that (be careful and search the forum for a few threads that address this before doing so)."

    "comment": "Hi, Since the moment I saw first time the F40 it become my \"wet dream\", when and where it was I don't remember. I'm not sure if I ever could afford to buy one of them, I hope I could. This would after five, ten or maybe 20 years. There is one large issue, at that time it could cost around 2$-3$mil or more. Well, I don't want to wait so long. Same time I can't afford it now. I was start think about my current possibilities how to satisfy my dream and emotions. I think most of people who decide to buy F40, they are buying emotions, feelings etc not a car with four wheels and steering. Actually this is what I'm looking for too. In life it happened that I'm crazy about engineering and cars. As well I thought about investment object and you can call it four or fifth pension level. My idea is to built own F40 but with at least 70-80% OEM parts. I can start Today to work on this project and with every day small steps I will come closer and closer to my dream. I'm entrepreneur and there are always some business issue behind. Maybe it can turn in to something bigger. So, instead to save money in stocks, bonds and other stupid stuff, I decide to invest in F40. That I can afford with time. I'm owner of company what is in the industry of thermal cutting(plasma). I have possibility to do complicated assemblies in Solidworks, I have engineer who know how. My profession is production of non standard metalwork machinery. I'm not educated engineer, but I'm familiar with cnc, servo drive systems, welding etc. I'm looking for individual who would be so kind and help me with technical info of F40. Share or even sell. My first problem is, that it's impossible to buy F40 chassis(mine frame), even crashed. I will have to built it from scratch. Maybe somebody have one and could sell it to me for reasonable money. The rest of stuff, started from nuts till engine can be ordered at distributors or at Ferrari Classiche. I see my project done in 5-10 years. Estimate budget, as many as it will be neccesary. As a gift lot emotions, pain and dose of fun. Also self education process to better understand how to build the sports car."

    "comment": "Plugzit and I were \"Stoogestorming\" (a kind of theorizing Stooge-style on stuff) about our favorite Ferrari, the F40.  It shares a lot of Ferrari DNA with our beloved 348's, so we were thinking about the next great Stooge project possibly being an F40 Homage based on a 348 donor car. What do you think?  How would you do it?  Here's our scope: Secure an early salvage title Berlinetta donor car, possibly a twin-disk clutch car.  Used race cars are possible. Remove everything that weights anything that doesn't make the car go fast.  Keep the A/C because F40's have it.  Go from front to back to create lightness.  The goal is a street legal, smog compliant, 2800 lb. car, less if possible, but we don't think that is likely.  We figured we'd need to lighten the front and rear bumpers, replace the exhaust system, dump the heavy interior parts, remove the trunk panels, change the headlight buckets to something fixed and glassed over like the Le Mans cars, replace the battery with a light lithium one, windows to manual opening, light weight seats, carpet swapped for another lighter material. Performance-wise we need to rebuild the engine with lower compression pistons for turbo charging, add turbos and intercoolers and aftermarket engine management.  Need higher flow injectors. Upgrade the front brakes at least, need performance 18\" wheels and tires, add rear wing and front spoiler, either the SS lip spoiler or a modest tray. Optional stuff would be plexi windows, not the front windscreen, shock rebuild, sway bars, brake cooling ducts, remove side strakes, new paint and body work, etc. What would you guys do?  The all-in budget would be less than $100K.  Target output is around 500HP.  Can we get that out of 3.4 liters?  Remember the F40 has 2.9 liters displacement."

I think an F40-inspired build would be very cool... and likely end up in a way similar to the 348 GTCs, and CSAI-GT and Michelotto Competizione cars, where lightness, function, and race-derived elements are the points of inspiration. Liberal replacement of body panels with carbon fiber clones from front to back, stripped interior with carbon inner door panels, plexi windows, mousehair interior dash/console covering like in the F40 would be cool, F40/GTC or F40-US/SS seats, centerlock wheels, etc."

Somebody posted pics of it a while ago on FChat, but I can't find them anymore. However when they were posted I managed to print them out and modelled this F40 after it: Talk about a labor of love. I thought no big deal, cut the roof off, paint it yellow and be done with it. Well, turns out this took me weeks on/off to work on. Anything you see on the pictures has been painted and in all likelihood been modified. One of the biggest changes was the front hood \"hole\". A friend of mine did that on his mill (thick metal) and I rebuilt the structure underneath it. Completely redid the interior and added the rollbar out of a F355 Challenge car. However I made the bar too low, but it is so glued into place, I can't fix that anymore. Fire extinguisher and rear wing are parts from a F40 LM kit. Tires are slicks and all other additional parts were scratch built. Paint job was the hardest and it took me a few models to get it right. The car you see is assembled out of about 5 other cars. Talk about a complex project."

Adjustable Suspension: Does it work and does it require frequent maintainence and repair? How firm a hand do you need to change gear?

My favorite car to drive is the F40 BECAUSE it is a very RAW car. Lots of feed back. Manual steering and brakes. If you have to worry about the clutch, forget about it, the brakes are just as tough if not more so. (at least on my car) Every move in this car needs to be deliberate. The steering is heavy at slow speeds, yet a dream at high speeds. I like the adjustable suspension because you CAN drive the car anywhere without worrying about a speed bump or parking garage with a steep exit. I also like the Euro belts because they eliminate the \"mouse track\" seatbelts. Anything more than 1/2 throttle above 4000rpm in the lower gears will break the rear tires loose. Sure, floor it from 2500 in high gear on the freeway and it is going to need to spool up. Downshift to 3rd and do the same thing and you will be over 100mph before you know it. It fits about like the ZR1 corvette. My daily driver. My least favorite is my Z06. It is powerful, yet it has very little feel. The Brakes, clutch, and steering can easily be handled by a 90 lb weekling. Way too soft for my taste, yet O.K. to take out on a date. I drive my F40 any day of the week, but I wouldn't want to drive it EVERY day of the week. Hope this helps, Rick"

    "comment": "So I blew a seal on the left bank turbo this weekend just running down the street for some milk.  Scared the cr&p out of me as the backend of the car was covered with a nasty mixture of oil and coolant?  Once we tore it down it was apparent the problem came from the turbo. I was hoping to get some opinions on upgrading to the LM Turbo setup that Carabou racing is marketing.  I've gotten several comments from the folks who rebuild the engine that the LM turbo's are too big for the type of street driving I do and would probably be disappointing unless I planned to track the car.  Their comments are that the larger turbos take longer to spool up, so I'd experience more lag at the bottom end.  I spend most of my miles on the street as I only get to the track once or twice a year so I'm not looking to build a top-end monster. I also got a strange response from FNA when I asked about availibility of a replacement turbo, they said that there where two turbos mfged, a standard on the older cars and an \"enhanced\"  they said they only have enhanced in stock so if I indeed have the older turbos I'd have to replace both?  Anybody ever hear of this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks Jon"

It is not bigger. It has roller bearings instead of bushings. The inlet does provide better airflow. The impeller design is improved also. It actually comes in sooner, not later. Therefor it is more driveable, not less. So your choices are to either rebuild your turbo, find a used one (I have 2 but I don't want to sell yet) (they make great upgrades for a 288) Or buy the new turbos with new chips. You should see another 35+/- HP with this change. You can get the Turbos and chips from Rod at FAI 949 631-6373 or from Tate at Carabu 949 722-9307. Rod should be a little cheaper. I think he builds the chips for Tate. Rick"

This is a pretty good thread to point you in the right direction about the evolution of the F40 and how it came into being: http://ferrarichat.com/forum/showthread.php?t=16552&page=1&pp=20 You should be looking to spend around $300,000, perhaps a little more for a good example.  Most tend to agree that it's far better to get a car with higher mileage and some track time that has been well cared for than one that has sat in a garage and never seen the track."

The one at newport autosports is a beautiful car, dont get me wrong on that one. But you'll be looking to spend more on servicing the car. For me I'd actually go with a lower miliage car and spend the extra buck to service it. Just my 2 cents. -Alex"

It is the GRIP model but OMP only makes this model with a fiberglass shell.  I believe that all the carbon shell seats were made exclusively for Ferrari (yet another Ferrari monopoly on something ).  The carbon shells of my seats have a very similar weave/color to the actual carbon/kevlar that appear under the hood and engine hatch - sort of the light tan color.  It matches perfectly. One of my closest friend's cousin does all the custom interior for the DUB show cars.  I gave him a photo of the design of seat (quilted look) and he matched it perfectly in alcantara.  If you find a set of seats that need recovering I can help you.  He's also a fraction of the cost of anyone else (probably because of my relationship with my buddy).  Anyway, if you (or anyone) needs help with recovering seats - I know the person!"

I think i learned that with club plates you could drive the car for a 20km radius around the registered address for \"testing purposes\"? so, theoretically, a carrera gt could be imported from the states and driven under the same arrangement? is this true? scott you can probably answers these qs!"

It is well documented here this is my dream car and I have also asked these questions ap355 on numerous occasions.  360C has clearly confirmed that you can't \"legally\" drive these things on the road.  From my understanding if something happens its goiing to hit the fan.  Dealer plates are used for the sole purpose of moving a non registered vehicle from one place to another or for demonstration etc. The best place to own one that is close by is NZ."

I heard they cracked down on dealer plates a little while back because it was being abused (Guy in my old Corvette club used to run a rare LHD model on trade plates, not that his business had ANYTHING to do with car sales, but this was before they got tight on it) People still run the risk, and I guess they can afford it if they get in trouble.

    "comment": "I looked into this here in Mount Isa actually. I talked to the guys at the local transport department about driving LHD cars on the road legally. They said any LHD car that is 30 yrs old can be registered in QLD and driven daily. As long as it has the appropriate stickers on it saying it is LHD etc...etc. Any LHD car under 30 yrs old can be registered through a car club under \"club rego\". This means the car can be driven on the road for \"testing after modifications/re-fueling/testing after repairs/fitting new tyres/driving to and from car shows etc..etc. All have to be done within a 20 km radius of where the car is garaged. A letter from the Club President is proof that your LHD car is part of the Club which qualifies it for Club Rego. I have thought about this MANY times..........then come to the conclusion that I will be ****ed if I ever want to take a car that is not 30 yrs or older anywhere but 20 km from my house. We are lucky here in Mount Isa as its 10 km to the other side of town, so I reckon I could drive anywhere here without the worry of being out of my 20 km radius zone. What if I want to take the car for a drive out of town?? Im screwed then. Even if I trailered it to Townsville or Brisbane, I wouldnt be allowed to drive it as its out of the 20 km radius zone. So you have to be pretty keen to take it on with Club Rego. Also, from memory. Trade plates are only valid from 8am-5pm. Anything after that and you are asking for trouble. Especially if an accident occurs. Also, trade plates are a lot like Club Rego. You are not allowed/supposed to cut laps while on trade plates, even in the specified times. They are just so you can drive the car from one place to another."

The trade plate is for the sole use of demonstrating a vehicle that is not registered or for trasnporting a vehicle from say dealership to mechanical garage. There are other minor exceptions to the rule but its simple. 4. If the trade plate is used outside of its designated use and an accident occurs the comp insurance as well as third party can be revoked. Also the bodily injury insurance can also be revoked. 5. A LHD car can only be regisitered if its 30 years old in Vic SA NSW QLD......not sure about WA or NT or ACT or Bathurst Island. 6. The only exceptions are: international guests with their cars, ie, US armed forces based in Pine Gap (when it existed) and Woomera SA. 7. 288GTO, F40, F50 cannot be registered until 30 years of age and compliance with ADR's is required. 8. 360 and 430 CH's cannot be registered because of the full roll cage, LHD and ADR failures. 9. A predecent was set with the McLaren F1 (cos no one knew how to rule a middle hand drive car) so i you want to roll the dice and play god with a trade plate.....then do it, have a prang and someone gets hurt......good luck! I have even tried legally with the F40 in WA and through a dealer there its basically a no go zone even though I was told of some 15 year rule and then again its ADR compliance that is the killer, those that have \"cars\" registered there are either doing it illegally or have found a now closed loop hole."

In 2006 I sat through a trial on the bench for 1.5 days over this exact issue. Some bloke decided to use a trade plate on a LHD corvette (86 cross flow), he was stopped by police on a Sunday and his defence stated that he was test driving the car. The judge did not see it that way and my opinion was that he was just out cruising. The judge came out with the act in regards to trade plates and tore it to pieces, he made me read it a gazzillion times and as such i took it in. After all evidence and stat decs were produced it came down to how the judge saw and interpreted the act. The decision was loss of drivers lic for 6 months, $650.00 fine and loss of trade plate for 2 years to the owner of the plate who was not the owner of the car but a mate who was a dealer. The final coup de ta was that the judge said and he pulled no punches in stating if an accident had occurred SGIC, the state bodily injury insurer would not cover the insurance because the accident whoever was at fault it didnt matter but that the vehicle was not registered and it was a failure to comply with the trade plate act. A provision is made in SA that if a car is unregistered the bodily injury insurance would still take hold because the insurance act states that a \"balloon\" needs to be set aside to cover someone who may have forgotten or couldnt be bothered to register a car. Trade plates are strictly enforced and if abused and an accident occurs......get ready to pay big time, the can of worms opened would lead to a very long stay in the court system and i believe far outweighing the benefit of driving a car that is unregisterable and non complied with ADR's. The moral is simple.....I wouldnt do it."

When I went to actually see the car, it was still at their shop due to bad weather and I was blown away by the experience. I expected a nice little exotic car niche garage. Instead, Wayne has a full restoration shop, a body shop, a mechanical shop and a sales room. They had all kinds of old ferraris, mercedes and jags being restored. If you are ever in Hartford Conn area, and love old ferrari's, their shop is worth a visit.

I was looking at the engine bay, however, and wondered what the larger diameter section of pipe on the wastegate outlet is right before it hooks to the exhaust (as shown by the arrow I added). My 91 US version F40 doesn't have this larger section. Instead, the pipe is the same diameter all the way to the exhaust. An enquiring mind wants to know! Image Unavailable, Please Login"

A couple of questions, wonder if this F-40 was repaired, with values being quite a bit lower when apparently this crash happened, and, does Carfax cover cars in Canada, & do  their titles get branded salvage/rebuilt, as in the U.S. ?  With the amount of damage done, it should not have a clean title. Another great reason for getting a PPI."

I had obviously interupted Wayne while he was in the middle of some body work, and he ended up spending more than an hour talking to me about the purchase process for a Ferrari. Even though I was looking for a 328 (F40 had no 328s for sale, nor was Wayne aware of any that were for sale in the area), he chose to put off his work and talk to me about the cars in his show room and how I could best go about finding the car I was looking for even if it didn't involve F40 selling me a car. Its hard to say enough about someone who will go out of their way to help you when there was nothing in it for them. I would whole-heartedly recommend F40 and Wayne if they have the car that you are looking to purchase. Peter is in Gaylordsville, F40 is in Portland. TWS"

C'mon, the idea that you are going to use these for your \"trips\" is a bit crazy. Mainly because you're really not going to go with the wife on an around Europe trip in an F40 are you? I mean you'll use something much more practical and comfortable  to do that, right? . The F40 is a racer, not a grand tourer. Let's not pretend. I'm sure you won't lose a sale when it comes to selling if the luggage are not there either.... Sorry to bang on. Just couldn't help myself. Maybe I'm in a grumpy mood......."

Its not only the fact that it's noisy, has a hard suspension, and the seats are not that comfy, but its also because she'll need to keep bracing herself every five minutes due to the fact that I'll be  constantly using the available perfomance and thus scaring the bejesus out of her! Luggage or no luggage either... Come to think of it I don't think I'd want to go all the way to Monaco in it either. At least not from London. But hey that's just me. Grumpy old so and so..... : )"

I had one done, it was a rare, right hand drive one, it was built by Ferrari for the Challenge Series, and like a lot of them, was modified by Ferrari UK. It was not easy to get it road registered as they don't come with a handbrake, so you have to modify the bells to fit the bigger wheels. Dick Lovett, at Swindon, have got it for sale, have a look at their website.  It is up for £59,000 (I think they may be being a bit ambitious), it has only done around 5,000 miles, it is absolutely mint, but to be fair, it is not an easy car to drive on the road, especially if you have lose fillings!! And if you haven't any when you get in it, you will have when you get out!! There were more and more coming on the market, so I decided to part ex it for my 360M, this proved to be the right choice, as Dick Lovett still have it for sale!  See pictures attached..........

I brought it to race, but it was such a nice car, and there was so much 'carnage' going on in the 355 Series, that I just did a few track days in it.  I hardly used it last year, due to pressure of work, building houses and things, and I must admit I got used to not having the bills, you know what they are like, racing, I am sure! I honestly cannot remember what set up we were using suspension wise, but the car has all the 1997 upgrades, bigger anti-roll bar, extra gearbox cooling, rear wing, quick rack.  It is a really lovely car.  It has a sports exhaust on it at the moment, but I have still got the SPA Challenge exhaust, here in my garage!  And boy, does that sound brilliant!  I think it is called the SPA Exhaust, as that is probably the only place you would be able to use it in Europe!  I did a track day at Le Mans and Montiery (near Paris) we were allowed to use the exhaust there, does sound fantastic!  A bit intrusive, and I must say gets on your t*ts on the road!  There are a lot of left hand drive ones around for sale, most of them have been bashed!  You can pick them up for around £35,000, but this one has never been hit, had a slight scuff on one cill, but apart from that is mint!  Go on......... Spoil yourself!!!  I am sure they would have a deal with you as they have had it so long! Kind regards RAY360M ps.... For a bit of fun, being a polisher aswell, I put it in a round of the Autoglym Concours Championship.  There were 6 cars in our class and we managed to win it!  See picture.

It was in april or may 2001 i think!! Must have a picture of it somewhere because i thought it was a fab car and i honestly thought that the owner must be someone pretty special to bring a challenge car all the way from the UK to Spa!! The ride must have been pretty hard! But of course all worth it! Driving at Spa is something special! And i can confirm....that car was LOUD!!! CIAO...

Then I hear a high pitched bellow, look in my mirror and see the massive wing of a red F40 behind the 355. We head onto the A64 (in roadworks - 50 limit), the two razzers pass me when the roadworks cease...I give the thumbs up and the F40 driver returns the gesture, nice! I followed them for a few miles, they turned off towards York, I followed them off and went back on the A64 in the opposite direction (as had gone too far on by following them!). They both were changing down the gears as they slowed up, sounded awesome, especially the F40 as it was banging and cracking on the over run. The plate on the F40 was ** IOU, I am sure I've seen the plate before.....maybe in a magazine test or something? The 355 may have been a Challenge version I think....it had white mag wheels, the front end looked a little different than standard too, and it was very loud! Are there any road going Challenge cars? I was on cloud 9 all Saturday night. Best Regards Martyn."

It was a 348 GT Competizione which was the last racing verson of the 348, the equivalent of the 355 challenge and is fully road legal. It has a customised exhaust which is the envy of everyone. We had both been to the Harewood Hill Climb as part of the Ferrari Hill Climb Championship. The 348 you saw was the fastest Ferrari on the day driven by last years championship winner. I usually compete in a 328GTS but I sold it recently after 13 years this left only the F40 which is not realy suitable for speed hill climbs as it is too powerful to drive fast on narrow twisty roads. The F40 is much better at speeds over 80mph. We had a great day (20+ Ferraris) and as you can imagine lots of pictures were taken of the cars. For more details and probably some pictures see www.ferrariownersclub.co.uk"

But what I noticed, in addition to the Ferrari, was the heightened attention which the F40 seemed to generate compared to, for example, my Ferraris and other \"run of the mill\" F cars.  It was just a wild scene!  To see an F40 on the road is a spectacle.  I think you're in for more of the same with your car.  It's a magnificent thing!"

As I drove along the double-lane highway toward my house, I could hear \"HEY! HEY!\" being yelled from a car that pulled alongside me. My passenger window was closed, so I pretended not to hear him and I didn't turn to look. The car backed off a bit, and then came alongside, so I accellerated a bit to move away. Bad luck - the light we were both approaching turned red, and the guy in front of him who should have stopped ran a very late yellow. So I was stuck at the light with the guy on my right. I still hadn't turned to engage him. \"HEY! HEEEEEY!\" I turned my head LEFT out my window, pretenting to look for the voice, then turned forward again. The light turned green, and I took off. Wouldn't you know it? The next light a few blocks away turned red. He pulled up again, and yelled: \"HEY!\" I finally turned to look. He was in the passenger seat, baby in the back seat, and his wife/girlfriend was driving. She was looking straight ahead like she's embarrased and never maked eye contact with me. The guy was in his mid 20s, and he looked \"greasy\" (goofy facial hair, etc.). They were in a beat up old green Honda. He held up his cell phone and yelled: \"CAN I CALL YOU?\" I shook my head and mouthed \"Um.... no.\" Then he yelled out: \"I'VE GOT A FAST CAR, TOO!\" I was slightly amused, especially since he was in the passenger seat. But I didn't want to be too big a jerk, so I just gave him the SCUBA \"OK\" sign and nodded. Thankfully, the light turned green (and there are no more lights for miles) and I took off again. But I was thinking \"I'm not going to let this guy follow me home\" so I planned to pass my street and keep driving into town. Luckily, he turned before I needed to. Silly boy. Why couldn't he just have been content to yell \"nice car, dude\" like all the regular admirers. I always wave and yell \"THANKS!\""

    "comment": "I completely disagree, Craig.  Steve is not elitist; he was complaining about the harassing behavior of the guy in the Honda.  The guy should have noted he was bothering Steve and backed off.  That's just polite. Of course, the dude's scraggly appearance and vehicle he's riding in doesn't help said person's case for trying to connect with Steve.  Looks like a duck, quacks like a duck... the odds that guy was a Seattle grunge band member with an Enzo and still behave that way is unlikely - he would contact fellow Ferrari owners, and in the Seattle area they'd know Steve. You certainly cannot argue that it is wrong to judge people on their grooming and hygiene. Features/body type are one thing that should be out of bounds (generally beyond change), but being clean and well-presented is a personal decision and is fair game for public judgement and discernment. If you grow 'goofy facial hair' and let your hair go matty you can argue against judgement all you want, but strangers and the public have nothing else to go by other than how you present yourself (sure, friends and family will know you). A few weeks ago I was playing around and clipped my goatee down to a big handlebar mustache.  I was out shopping and impulsively decided to visit a BMW dealer to see the new 5 series again (still doesn't click) and the non-US 320i.  I noticed that the salesguy was reticent to talk to me about the 3-series, until he asked what I had now and I pointed to my WRX (putting me in a potential sale scenario).  I puzzled over his hesitation to take me seriously, until on the way out I saw my own reflection and realized I looked like a biker with unkempt hair and a handlebar mustache!"

    "comment": "I think that as everyone else said, a Ferrari is a beautiful thing, enough to make any car lover get goofy. Maybe the guy had never seen an F40 in person before, and was just so excited. Now I can understand how this could be annoying, as my area is filled with rice cars, and people try to race you off of every light which just pisses me off, however, I have another problem with your post though. \"The guy was in his mid 20s, and he looked \"greasy\" (goofy facial hair, etc.).\" The way you say this sounds kind of like you are an elitest who is holding it against this guy just because he isn't driving a fast car and he dosen't look like he has a fast car. Point in case is the picture below, this guy (in my oppinion )could fit the description of your \"horsefly\". If he pulled up in the enzo, and said \" can I call you\" would you ignore him, no, because you would be looking at his car as well. I think that from your description this guy/girl/baby/whatever, didn't do anything unsafe, he pulled up next to you, to admire your car, and try to talk to you. Now maybe it is just me, but if anyone seemed like a creep in your relation of the story it was you for looking away and not paying any attention to him. People live their dreams through your success, or maybe he actually did own something better than a beat up honda civic, who knows. I just think that I would have been a lot more sympathetic if you hadn't been so judgmental about this guy's looks. Maybe he was creepy, who knows, I probably wouldn't have wanted him to know where I lived either, just seems like if I saw you crusing along in your Lexus, while I was in a Ferrari I might just think you were a creep by your looks if you talked to me, not that I have an oppinion either way, but not everyone has the best of looks, I certainly don't, and I am sure that people think that you don't either. Maybe next time you should just do a writeup about the way he acted rather than \"This greasy 20year old guy asked to call me because I was driving my awsomely fast, super sweet car, so that makes him an ******\".

You got a problem with that? but I digress again... \"Elitist\" isn't a word that those who know me would use to describe me - but you don't know me, so I won't expect you to believe it until you do know me better. Maybe \"greasy\" wasn't the right word. The picture you posted (with the Jamiroquai singer) looks nothing like the guy, and it wasn't so much the dude's look - it was his presence. He was creepy - in a stalker kind of way. I love to wave at, talk to, honk at, allow pictures to be taken by, and otherwise enjoy people who have true excitement and passion for these cars - but in every previous case over my past 7 years of Ferrari ownership NONE of the admirers have creeped me out like this guy. Did I say he was an ******? No. Did I make any judgements about him, his car, the girl, or the baby? No. You made those judgements. I typed a description. Well, OK - I did call him \"silly.\" That's a far cry from ******. I was there, you were not. It was an unpleasant encounter, but if that's the price of driving this car, that's fine. I just won't share that part of the experience with FChat. Easily done. My post was not meant in the spirit in which you seem to have taken it. That's probably a lack on my part of properly describing the encounter and my feelings about it in a digital medium."

Pacing, lane changing and circling by other people while I am driving my oldslow308 can be unnerving. Most of the time it is harmless but there are those out there that are pretty aggressive, with attitude, trying to prove something. I think that is what Steve was alluding to. Sometimes acknowlging these people just encourages them and their behavior. Judging the other guy by his looks was unfair but stereotypes develop for a reason and those reasons are usually based on experience. I am sure I sound like I am defending Steve but consider that maybe I am just relating to his own reaction to his situation. Although I was not driving my 308 at the time, I was circled and taunted by a truckload of 'good ole boys' out having a good time. I tried not to do anything thing that would encourage them and eventually they went away. If I had been driving my beater truck I would have played some 'fender tag' with them. THAT they would have understood. READ THE FIRST PARAGRAPH AGAIN."

For max performance I recommend the Alcon as thier metalurgy is a little different and they lasted longer under track conditions but were more expensive. Brembo changed thier mount ears design and we had to machine the lip from the rotor hat, not a big deal; Brembo may have changed this again, I haven't done this mod for a long time. Use slotted only for maximum life and performance under track conditions, choose drilled for the OE look. Pads, lots of good options; I'm biased toward Pagid, the OE supplier. Pagid blue was the original factory spec pad. Call a Brembo or Alcon dealer they've had this application for 20 years. You can also go with one of FChat's many performance parts suppliers. Best, Rob"

I do not have all my notes from the time of purchase but the car was brokered by Prestige Motorcar in Miami.  I seem to remember the original owner was a wealthy Texan, with a huge car collection, that tried to corner the market on F-40's and ended up losing a lot of money.  The name I am not remembering right now.  When I received the car it was basically perfect with the exception that the luggage was missing.  I was able to buy a set of the luggage shortly thereafter.  I did not look to verify but believe mileage is about 2200 at this point. The MC-12 is huge.  it is much longer, wider, and has a longer wheelbase than the Enzo.  The visibility is very tough and the car is less powerful than the Enzo.  That being said, I am told that the car is incredible on the track.  Not nearly as much fun on the street as the Enzo."

So my bro and I went for a cruise in Greeneville today to see what we could spot since the horse events are going on, traffic was terrible so we hit the backroads, coming out passed all traffic after awhile, joking about seeing the F40 all day long. We're driving, we're chatting, F40!!!! Bro spots it at a gas station so we pull in, as he is pulling out. We follow of course. On the offramp of 52 towards Wilmington, we're behind, I'm snapping pics, or trying to. I hear whisteling, bro downshifts floors it. F40 makes the best music I've ever heard, whistle gets rediculously loud, bye bye Ferrari. We're doing 110+ in my my brother's 911 trying to atleast keep track of him, no use in even trying to keep next to it or within a football field of it. Pull up at the light next to it, speechless. Words can't describe what I was seeing. The gentleman driving was incredibly nice as so was his wife. We chatted until the light changed and off he went in a roar. We followed for a few minutes and then let him go his way. I told him about ferrarichat and he said he will check it out. So I figured I'd make this thread for the story and \"F40 guy\" if you join, please introduce yourself! -Wes P.S.

Average mileage = 10,000 to 30,000. High mileage = beyond that point. I bet owners and enthusiasts alike have a different perspective on this, and my thoughts are that the numbers will be lower for those in the USA as compared to those outside the USA.

I'd say you should drive at least 30 miles once a month, which over 20 years is 7200 miles - still under 10K and \"low\" in my view.  A car with under 5,000 miles is driven under an average of 20 miles a month - probably not properly warmed up each drive and I'd personally shy away from it (unless I want a static museum piece not really intended to be driven).  Just passed 14K on ours which is an average of 60 miles a month over its life, not exactly huge mileage.  The use we give it means filters, selas, gaskets, belts, fluids, etc are current, changed and used enough to do their jobs."

I ended up buying a 14,000 mile unmodified car because I was going to drive it around 1,000 miles per year and I wanted a car that had not been messed with.  The only rub against the car I bought through Joe S was that it was higher mileage and priced accordingly. I tend to agree with Joe's initial accessment of mileage but IMO I feel the modified vs. unmodified issue is an order of matter of greater importance in a numer of buyer's minds; at least it was in mine.

But the car looks as though it has done 15000 miles on it! Ok as a result I bought it a significant discount, and I bought it with the aim of effectively recommissioning it entirely, including an engine rebuild! The car basically did most of its miles in the first 9 years of its life then sat around the remainder collecting dust. So what that it has a very low mileage. I have seen cars with three times that mileage in pristine condition. So its not really that much about mileage but the condition. Overall I prefer it if a 20 year old car has between 8-12k miles on it because, like others have already stated, it means the moving parts have actually had a chance to do just that.... And its also less likely to have been forgotten by the owner because it was stuck in storage. Out of sight means out of mind!"

    "comment": "IMO that is a backwards perspective. Buying a low or very low mileage car of this type should be done for two reasons only. Reason one is for its long term collector value in which case it should be driven as little as possible, like from the trailer to the show grounds and the reviewing stand. Many of  the collectors I know fall into this catagory and many own another same or similar car to drive. Reason two, your own personal time machine. You really wanted one new but were a starving student and couldn't afford it. Now you can and every bit of patina can be yours. Not a bad choice either because in folding money an extreme low mile F40 is still cheaper the the selling premium they were going for in 1990 and if you calculate adjusted dollars even at todays price you are stealing it. We got a 10 year old TR with 900 miles for reason two. We paid less than 1/3 what the original owner did and with any luck I will live long enough to wear it out. It was cheap looked at with the correct perspective and every rock chip and leather crease is ours."

Also the car is perfect with the standard suspension anyway. Lamborghini has the adjustable and it is just a pain in the butt! 2) Harnesses...simple...Department Of Transportation will not allow them.Also during the time of the F40,348 and TR the DOT was requiring \"Passive Safety Devices\"...thus the mouse belt was born...and was later replaced with Air Bags....a major improvement. 3) The US car is a bit lower in power due to the cats, but all of this is relative since the boost knob can be turned up or down depending on your taste. Now keep in mind not all Euro cars are the same. A Swiss car is the lowest power due to their strict sound requirements. 4) As William stated...it will be tight. Also it depends on where your height is. If you are all legs it will be a problem, but if you are a mix of leg and upper body then you will fit...but it will be tight. There is room to modify the seat tracks a bit to get more room. I Williams car I think he is giving up a touch of room due to the additon of the 6 point harnesses. the mounting brakets for the harnesses raise the seats by about 0.5\" I am 6.0' and weigh 250 bodybuilder type pounds ( ie no beer gut )...I fit....like a glove in my opinion Ciao' Steve www.f1design.us _____ Hey Guys, does anyone know why the Euro cars received adjustable suspension while the US was stuck with the standard coil overs?

Juan Quintano, distributor for Spain at the time and a dealer in Madrid,  sold a car to Judith Hutchinson in summer of 1990 and I have been trhying to find the VIN number.    Thanks for any help you can give."

The magnesium has an \"Out Gasing\" problem that is fixed by having it treated with a Mil-Spec coating designed for sealing magnesium. Bleed the clutch hyd's first and see if the problem reoccures before jumping to that conclution.  In the last few years I have found numerous 40's with that problem just now starting to show up.

Serena, etc ... sorry for not being able to help you. Was it delivered and registered in Spain? I could look at the F40s registered in the summer of 1990 As I said, the list I have is of ALL the Ferraris registered in Spain, but only information regarding the vehicle. I only have information on the history of owners if they were registered in the Canary Islands."

Perhaps you saw this (rather dubious) Ad? 1991 Ferrari F40 = Coming Soon = 16,000 km + 390,000 For Sale on Car And Classic UK [C296713] The Ad offers ZFFGJ34B000089692. The pics feature a car in Australia, and a car in the UK. Red flag number one. It suggests that the car is somewhat unavailable and located in Japan since the broker has an Oregon USA phone number (503 974 9215) and the F40 is \"finishing mechanical restoration include new turbine and inspection of a fuel tank for YEN 9,000,000\". Red flag number two. The broker asks: \"Click this link for the pics\" ANTEA cars / The Special Room For Clients Said pics are clearly a different car from the F40 in the Carclassic Ad above. Red flag number three. The Ad goes on: \"Price: $$ Best Offer.... USD American dollars...\". Best offer in today's F40 market? Red flag number four. A quick check on the phone number the broker uses reveals this from last year: http://www.ferrarichat.com/forum/141600686-post622.html And this: http://www.ferrarichat.com/forum/141600898-post623.html And this: http://www.ferrarichat.com/forum/141603278-post626.html Red flags numbers five, six & seven. There are other issues on other car forums (Musclecars & Maseratis!) with this same broker with the Oregon phone number, but I think at this point you can draw your own conclusions. I hope I am safe in suggesting that perhaps we have saved you, yet again!"

So it's just for negotiating bumpy city streets, and lowering for higher speed roadways. One of our members here has it installed, perhaps he'll offer up his experiences. Adding a six point harness is easy (except for upholstery) to a USA car, and adds NO height to the seat. At 6'-3\" you'll be tight, but you must sit and drive to find out. Yes, the US cars do have a bit more power, not less, than Euro spec cars due to the exhausts hot catalysts.  This is confirmed by a factory source known to me when the cars were new in 1992-3.  He stated most USA engines dyno'd closer to 500 bhp, as opposed to 478 bhp. Best regards, Rob Schermerhorn"

The problem is they dont get stored so once you switch the engine off they will get deleted. It does sound like a dry of loose connector causes intermittent issues, hence the bank with that ecu playing up. Only real way is to leave it with a weber specialist so they can take the car out and download the code as it happens, otherwise you end up chasing your tail and replacing endless sensors."

The couple of cars I have looked at have not been to my satisfaction, however I have found a perfect exsample! with 11000 kilometers, but it was registerd in 95' It has ally fuel tanks and ajustable ride hight. I was realy looking for a car with out ajustable dampers, but after trying the car, it makes cense to have the extra ride hight if needed to get the car in & out of garages or to get it over uneven surfaces. I also thought that ally tanks were only for the USA & Swiss customers or did they all have the ally tanks in the last year of build as well?  My qestions are: Can the ride hight be reprogrammd to only operate when I wish it to rather than when the car is started where it rises to it medium or full hight then you have to waight till you exced 25 KPH for it to revert back to normal driving hight? Other cars like the Enzo, I believe will only operate when the ride hight button is pressed. Also, I would like to fit a Tubi system to the car, I would like to ratain the cats but fit the LM pipes! the enginer that has worked on the car thinks I may get a problem with over boosting buy doing this. He did say he may be able to dial some of it out but possibly not it all. What is the best option to go for? Any experience with these issues would be a great help. Mark...."

Ross I would check ALL of your water lines/couplings as you could just have just worn out a seal or a loose fitting. I always used Teflon tape on these connections even after I upgraded to A/N fittings. Also you could have a cylinder head stud that has come loose which will allow water/coolant to be released. As Bas mentioned you could have a blown seal, these things happen within seconds and are no fault of your own. Please keep us informed ok? All the best, Gregg"

I'll see if I can find the shop again. The head gaskets are quite complicated and since there were only 2500 F40s built nobody makes them in such small quantities.  So we are Hosed"

I love mine and I put 3 to 4,000 miles year on it but, I must admit I am always tired when I get out! The noise, the acceleration, the deceleration the fact that everyone, including the police are watching your every move, well it just overwhelms you after a while. If you are over 5' 11\" it is a tight fit.... I do not remember who said it on here, but it was the best answer I have heard.. I would drive my F40 anyday of the week, just not everyday of the week.... An everyday driver, easy a 550/575 no question.... Chris (Parr)"

    "comment": "In the UK if the vehicle has not been struck from the DVLA registry via a cat A or B insurance marker then as long as you use the original chassis you can rebuild the car and have it registered here under its original number plate and VIN. Alternatively you can use a brand new chassis supplied by the manufacturer to transfer the VIN onto, however you cannot use an existing used chassis to do that to, otherwise you end up with a Q prefix on the numberplate and lose the official Ferrari name as the manufacturer on the title paperwork, which kills the value of the completed car anyway It all depends I guess which country the car is currently registered in, and where you actually want to register it. The only cars where it is financially viable to do such is when the cache of the model is worth more than the sum of its used parts. The classic example is the 250 SWB and GTO which can be built from scratch for under a million dollars, the VIN number then adds the rest of the value to the car. The other example was Rowan Atkinsons F1 which could be fully rebuilt for far less than its market value despite being virtually wiped out in the accident. I would say in order to do such with an F40 then the parts for the build could only come from dubious sources to get it built under its final completed value. Also in the days of internet information share, the truth will come out anyway, just look at the last two F40s at auction which have had ground up rebuilds, neither sold as a result."

Back then, President of AC Milan, Silvio Berlusconi, was desperately trying to get Maradona, and supposedly he was ready to get Maradona whatever he wanted. In order to keep Maradona in Naples, President of Napoli, Ferlaino, has bought the very first F40 for Maradona ever to be produced...
